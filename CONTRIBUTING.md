# Contributor Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the FAQ app! Couple of things to note regarding contributions for FAQ.

First off, please make sure you have set up the application as specified in the [README](https://github.com/kevinlee12/faqs/blob/master/README.md). Once you've set up, please feel free to find an issue or file a new [issue](https://github.com/kevinlee12/faqs/issues/new) and we'll get you started!

## Submitting a Pull Request

Because we are using Github's PR feature, please see [Github's docs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if this will be your first PR on Github or first ever PR (in that case, welcome to open source!). As for FAQ, there's a few things to keep in mind:
 - Please title your PR's `Fix #ISSUENUM: Add x feature`, `Fix #ISSUENUM: Resolved y bug`, etc. This will automatically link your issue to the specific Github issue and close that issue once your PR has been merged.
 - There will be **two** automated checks - a code style (via Codacy) checker and a CLA checker. Please note that passing the code style checker doesn't mean that your code is all clear in terms of code style, we will still be looking at those. A CLA checker will check if you need to sign off a CLA, which you can do via your Github account (please note that you may have to do it for every PR). Passing these two automated tests will be a prerequisite for your code to be merged in.
 - We will be integrating an continuous integration test very soon, in the meantime, we ask that you test your code offline before making a PR (unless you would like feedback prior to merging, in that case, please indicate it in your PR).
 - Because this project is very new, we're still trying to work some out some kinks, so thanks for your understanding! :)
